# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

A deep learning project that classifies brain MRI images to detect and categorize different types of brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

## üß† Project Overview

This project implements a CNN-based classifier to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scan images. The model can distinguish between four different classes of brain conditions, making it a valuable tool for medical imaging analysis and diagnosis assistance.

## üéØ Objective

Develop an automated system that can:
- Detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI scans
- Classify different types of brain tumors
- Assist medical professionals in preliminary diagnosis
- Provide accurate and reliable predictions with 77% accuracy

## üìä Dataset

**Source**: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

**Dataset Characteristics**:
- **Classes**: 4 different categories
- **Image Format**: MRI scans
- **Input Shape**: 224 √ó 224 √ó 3 (RGB images)
- **Data Type**: Medical imaging data

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The CNN model follows a sequential architecture with the following key components:

### Network Structure:
```
Input Layer: (224, 224, 3)
‚Üì
Conv2D (32 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU
Conv2D (32 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2D + Dropout(0.25)
‚Üì
Conv2D (64 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU
Conv2D (64 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2D + Dropout(0.25)
‚Üì
Conv2D (128 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU
Conv2D (128 filters, 3√ó3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2D + Dropout(0.4)
‚Üì
GlobalAveragePooling2D
Dense (128 units) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
Dense (4 units) + Softmax
```

### Key Features:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Progressive filter increase (32 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 128)
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied after each convolution for stable training
- **Dropout Regularization**: Prevents overfitting (0.25, 0.4, 0.5)
- **Global Average Pooling**: Reduces parameters compared to flatten
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output
